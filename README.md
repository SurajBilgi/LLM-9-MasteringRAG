## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid AI architecture that combines the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the precision and up-to-date knowledge of external data sources. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge (which is static after training), RAG dynamically retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses it to ground and enhance the generated responses.

**Key Idea:**
- LLMs are great at language, but their knowledge is frozen at training time and can be inaccurate or outdated.
- By retrieving relevant documents or facts at inference time, RAG systems can provide more accurate, current, and contextually relevant answers.

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Enterprise chatbots and knowledge workers
- Customer support automation
- Research assistants
- Domain-specific Q&A (legal, medical, technical, etc.)

---

## Why RAG?

- **Accuracy & Trustworthiness:** Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data.
- **Up-to-date Knowledge:** The knowledge base can be updated independently of the LLM.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Smaller, cheaper LLMs can be used effectively when paired with strong retrieval.
- **Data Privacy:** Sensitive data can remain internal; only relevant chunks are retrieved as needed.
- **Explainability:** The system can show which documents were used to generate an answer.

## RAG Architecture: Theory and Practice

### Theoretical Overview

RAG is a two-stage process:
1. **Retrieval:** Given a user query, retrieve the most relevant documents (or chunks) from a large corpus using vector similarity search.
2. **Generation:** Feed the retrieved documents, along with the original query, into an LLM to generate a grounded, context-aware response.

**Diagram:**
```
User Query
    |
[Embed Query]
    |
[Vector Search] <--- [Knowledge Base (Documents/Chunks)]
    |
[Top-K Relevant Chunks]
    |
[LLM (with context)]
    |
[Generated Answer]
```

### Practical Implementation (as in this repo)
- **Document Loading & Chunking:** Using LangChain's loaders and splitters.
- **Embedding:** Using OpenAI or HuggingFace models to convert text to vectors.
- **Vector Store:** Using Chroma or FAISS for fast similarity search.
- **Retrieval:** Query embedding and top-K search.
- **Generation:** OpenAI LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) with retrieved context.
- **UI:** Gradio for chat interface.

---

## Key Components of RAG

### 1. Document Ingestion & Chunking
- **Why Chunk?**
  - Large documents are split into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval granularity and relevance.
- **How?**
  - `CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)`

### 2. Embedding Models
- **Purpose:** Convert text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.
- **Types:**
  - **OpenAI Embeddings:** Proprietary, high-quality, via API.
  - **HuggingFace Embeddings:** Open-source, privacy-friendly, e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- **Auto-Encoding LLMs:** Used for embedding (e.g., BERT, OpenAI's embedding models).

### 3. Vector Store (Database)
- **Purpose:** Store embeddings and metadata for fast similarity search.
- **Popular Options:**
  - **Chroma:** SQLite-based, easy to use, good for prototyping.
  - **FAISS:** Facebook AI Similarity Search, highly efficient for large-scale retrieval.

### 4. Retriever
- **Abstraction:** LangChain's retriever interface allows easy switching between vector stores.
- **Function:** Given a query, return the top-K most similar document chunks.

### 5. LLM (Generator)
- **Role:** Generate answers using both the user query and the retrieved context.
- **Model Used:** OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini (low-cost, high-quality).

### 6. Conversational Memory
- **Purpose:** Maintain chat history for multi-turn, context-aware conversations.
- **Implementation:** `ConversationBufferMemory` in LangChain.

### 7. User Interface
- **Tool:** Gradio for rapid prototyping and deployment of chatbots.

## Step-by-Step RAG Pipeline (with Implementation)

### 1. Load and Chunk Documents
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

folders = glob.glob("knowledge-base/*")
documents = []
for folder in folders:
    doc_type = os.path.basename(folder)
    loader = DirectoryLoader(folder, glob="**/*.md", loader_cls=TextLoader, loader_kwargs={'encoding': 'utf-8'})
    folder_docs = loader.load()
    for doc in folder_docs:
        doc.metadata["doc_type"] = doc_type
        documents.append(doc)

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

### 2. Create Embeddings and Vector Store
```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
# or, for FAISS:
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Chroma
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embeddings, persist_directory="vector_db")
# FAISS
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embedding=embeddings)
```

### 3. Set Up Retrieval and LLM Chain
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7, model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key='chat_history', return_messages=True)
conversation_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm=llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory)
```

### 4. User Interaction (Gradio UI)
```python
import gradio as gr

def chat(question, history):
    result = conversation_chain.invoke({"question": question})
    return result["answer"]

gr.ChatInterface(chat, type="messages").launch(inbrowser=True)
```

## Vector Stores: Chroma vs. FAISS

- **Chroma:**
  - Easy to use, SQLite-based, good for small to medium datasets.
  - Integrates seamlessly with LangChain.
- **FAISS:**
  - Developed by Facebook AI, optimized for large-scale, high-dimensional vector search.
  - More scalable for production systems.
- **Switching:**
  - LangChain makes it easy to switch between vector stores with minimal code changes.

---

## Embeddings: OpenAI vs. HuggingFace

- **OpenAI Embeddings:**
  - High quality, but requires API access and data leaves your environment.
- **HuggingFace Embeddings:**
  - Open-source, can run locally, better for privacy and cost control.
- **Choosing:**
  - Use OpenAI for best performance and ease of use.
  - Use HuggingFace for privacy, cost, or when data must remain internal.

---

## Visualization of Embeddings

- **Why Visualize?**
  - To understand how your documents are distributed in vector space and to debug clustering or retrieval issues.
- **How?**
  - Use t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to reduce high-dimensional vectors to 2D or 3D.
  - Plot with Plotly for interactive exploration.

```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Assume vectors, doc_types, and colors are prepared as in the notebook

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
reduced_vectors = tsne.fit_transform(vectors)
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter(
    x=reduced_vectors[:, 0],
    y=reduced_vectors[:, 1],
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(size=5, color=colors, opacity=0.8),
    text=[f"Type: {t}<br>Text: {d[:100]}..." for t, d in zip(doc_types, documents)],
    hoverinfo='text'
)])
fig.show()
```

## Conversational Memory and Multi-Turn RAG

- **Purpose:** Maintain context across multiple user turns for more natural, coherent conversations.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use `ConversationBufferMemory` in LangChain to store chat history.
  - The LLM receives both the current query and previous exchanges, enabling context-aware responses.

---

## User Interface: Gradio Integration

- **Why Gradio?**
  - Rapidly prototype and deploy chatbots with a user-friendly web interface.
- **How?**
  - Wrap your RAG pipeline in a simple function and launch with `gr.ChatInterface`.

---

## Advanced Topics and Best Practices

- **Chunk Size Tuning:** Experiment with chunk size and overlap for optimal retrieval.
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combine keyword and vector search for best results.
- **Metadata Filtering:** Use metadata (e.g., document type) to filter or boost retrieval.
- **Callbacks and Logging:** Use LangChain callbacks to debug and monitor retrieval/generation steps.
- **Security:** Ensure sensitive data is handled appropriately, especially when using cloud APIs.
- **Scalability:** For large corpora, consider distributed vector stores and batch processing.
